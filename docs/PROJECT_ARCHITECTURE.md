## Architecture Rules

- Navigation logic belongs only in navigation.js.
- Quiz logic belongs only in quiz.js.
- AI logic belongs only in ai.js.
- Authentication belongs only in auth.js.
- Shared functions belong only in utils.js.
- Never mix unrelated logic in one file.

---

## Long-Term Goal

Build a scalable AI learning platform that can evolve from LocalStorage to Supabase and PostgreSQL without major architectural changes.
